# Crop Mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Optical Remote Sensing

Materials for the [*Crop Mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Optical Remote Sensing*](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/arset-crop-mapping-using-synthetic-aperture-radar-sar-and-optical-0?utm_source=social&utm_medium=ext&utm_campaign=AdvancedAg-23).

## Theory

Slides for the theory part of the course are available here [Remote Sensing and Change Detection](./Theory/Slides.pdf).

## Preparation

The repository consists of two directories with the materials, installation instructions, theory and practical information.

* [Optical](Optical/README.md)
* [SAR](SAR/README.md)

The repository can be synchronized using `git pull` or downloaded as a zip file. The data used for the practical exercise can be downloaded from [ARSET](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/arset-crop-mapping-using-synthetic-aperture-radar-sar-and-optical-0?utm_source=social&utm_medium=ext&utm_campaign=AdvancedAg-23). 

Each practical has corresponding install instructions which should be completed in advance.
